    Let's see, I probably should introduce myself. <span id="me">I'm Mike.</span> How are you?</p>

    I live in the shadow of Washington DC, in Ashburn, Va with my lovely wife, three children that I adore, and a mischievous fox hound. I've lived in Northern Virginia pretty much my whole life.

    I've been doing photography since 2001, but have been doing <strong><em>weddings</em></strong> since 2008. What did I 
    shoot before that? Mainly <strong><em>portraits</em></strong>, some promotional shots for local bands, various <strong><em>events</em></strong>, 
    that sort of thing. I decided to jump headfirst into weddings because they are a mix of all 
    of that. Even better, I get to spend time with people on one of the happiest days of their 
    lives, documenting it so that one day their grand-kids will be able to compare their wedding 
    dress to grandma's.</p>

    On weekends when I'm not at a wedding, often I'm spending time with <strong><em>families</em></strong> or 
    their <strong><em>kids</em></strong> capturing their ever changing smiles. I love seeing the changes 
    in a <strong><em>newborn</em></strong> through their first year. 
    It is completely amazing how fast they grow and change in just 12 months!</p>

    I love <strong><em>documenting people's lives</em></strong> and <strong><em>capturing moments</em></strong> 
    that can be beautifully displayed in 
    their homes for years to come. I consider the images I have of my own children priceless, and 
    hope to <strong><em>provide people with images they cherish</em></strong> just as much.</p>

    My oldest daughter has gotten to the point that she often tells me, "No Pictures!" <br>because I can't stop 
    taking pictures of her. And my son now makes a beeline for me if he sees me trying to take 
    pictures of him because he wants to steal the camera! My <strong><em>memories</em></strong> 
    are often triggered by images, 
    so especially while my children are young I'm taking pictures constantly so that I can remember 
    in the years to come how wonderful life is now.</p>
  
  <p>I'd love to do the same for you.  </p>
